- ALWAYS use English for code comments and commit messages, even if the project is primarily in another language. This ensures that the codebase is accessible to a wider audience and can be easily understood by developers from different backgrounds.
- ALWAYS use i18n keys (en-es) for all user-facing text in the codebase. This allows for easy localization and ensures that the application can be easily translated into different languages without modifying the code.
- Use the same styles for all components, such as buttons, inputs, etc. This creates a consistent user experience and makes the application look more polished and professional. 
- Make sure to write the logic in a modular way. This means breaking down complex functions into smaller, reusable functions that can be easily tested and maintained. This also helps to improve the readability of the code and makes it easier for other developers to understand and contribute to the project.
