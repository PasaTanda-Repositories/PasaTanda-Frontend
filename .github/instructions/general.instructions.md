- ALWAYS use English for code comments and commit messages, even if the project is primarily in another language. This ensures that the codebase is accessible to a wider audience and can be easily understood by developers from different backgrounds.
- ALWAYS use i18n keys (en-es) for all user-facing text in the codebase. This allows for easy localization and ensures that the application can be easily translated into different languages without modifying the code.
- Use the same styles for all components, such as buttons, inputs, etc. This creates a consistent user experience and makes the application look more polished and professional.
